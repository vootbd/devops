Create 1 master and 2 worker kubernetes cluster using vagrant or lxc/lxd containers. 

Use ansible or any configuration management tool of your choice to download kubernetes 
binaries and install into those vms/containers. Create a kubeadm config file and use 
kubeadm to bootstrap kubernetes cluster using that configuration management tool. 

You can combine binary installation and configuration scripts or keep them separate.


Use CNI of your choice but it should be deployed using configuration management scripts
(ansible or other)

Deploy kubernetes dashboard and metric server in this cluster and expose it to nodeport.

Create a service account with the right privilege (provide RBAC file) to access kubernetes
dashboard. Host it into a public git repo with appropriate readme.

Your solution should contain instructions to setup vagrant or lxc/lxd containers.

Your solution should contain ansible or other configuration management tool scripts to install,
configure cluster, cni, deploy dashboard, metric server and create service account with rbac.
